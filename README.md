# Cloud resource management tools
This repository is a work in progress. This is where I am developing some basic custom tools for working with AWS and GCP resources using Python.

What you find here may or may not be useful (and may or may not be working) but are freely available nonetheless.

Always very grateful for any feedback.

## GCP Tools
At this time there are a few very basic scripts for managing Cloud Storage buckets and objects (BLOBS). This will be enhanced over time as I start integrating these with other GCP services.

## AWS Tools
Coming soon...
